I love turning ideas into reality and continually improving on my skills. With over 5 years of experience in Functional Software testing, transitioning to Test Automation has been one of my major career goals, 
and I am excited to show my learning journey with  **[Serenity Dojo Expansion Training](https://www.serenity-dojo.com/program-overview)** facilitated by John Ferguson Smart, on the tools and techniques
needed to deliver top-notch Agile/BDD Test automation.

# Sample Projects 

These projects illustrate my learning journey in the Test Automation world. 
Each one is designed as a stand-alone tutorial so that others can learn from my experience.

# JAVA FOR TESTERS

## [String Calculator](https://github.com/kingsedem/portfolio-string-calculator#string-calculator-kata)

The string calculator is a simple Java coding exercise that introduced me to the concepts and practice 
of TDD and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function simple mathematical expressions
into numerical results. Some of the techniques I learned doing this exercise included String manipulation, Lambda expressions
and streams, and String formatting in Java.

## [The Java Fruit shop calculator](https://github.com/kingsedem/The-Java-fruit-shop#fruit-shop-cart-calculator-kata)

The Java fruit shop kata introduced  me to the concepts and practice of  TDD, using JUnit 5 @BeforeEach annotations, Map 
and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function that checks the prices of items 
in a catalog and updates it with the current market price. It also performs other functions
such as (displaying products in alphabetical order, adds the total item and throws appropriate exceptions where applicable).

## [The Speaking clock Kata](https://github.com/kingsedem/the-speaking-clock#speaking-clock-kata)

The goal of this code kata is to design a Conversational Clock with clusters of objects, capable of telling the current 
system time in a conversational format. It introduced me to the use of LocalTime (an immutable date-time object that represents a time).

# CODING TECHNIQUES (Essential Patterns for Sustainable Test Automation)

## The Builder Pattern:  
Due to the limitations of the use of default and parameterized constructors,the builder pattern is an easy way to make our codes more expressive and readable.

## [Vet Clinic Kata](https://github.com/kingsedem/vet-clinic#essential-patterns-for-sustainable-test-automation-using-builder-patterns)

The Vet clinic kata is a simple Java coding exercise which introduced me to the concepts and practice of
builder patterns in test automation. I used concepts such as interface, constructors, and 
creating optional and mandatory fields in each test classes to complete each test.
