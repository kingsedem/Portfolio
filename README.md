Each one is designed as a stand-alone tutorial so that others can learn from my experience.

## [String Calculator](https://github.com/kingsedem/portfolio-string-calculator#string-calculator-kata)

The string calculator is a simple Java coding exercise that introduced me to the concepts and practice 
of TDD and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function simple mathematical expressions
into numerical results. Some of the techniques I learned doing this exercise included String manipulation, Lambda expressions
and streams, and String formatting in Java.
