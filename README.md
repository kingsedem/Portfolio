# Sample Projects
These projects illustrate my learning journey in the Test Automation world. 
Each one is designed as a stand-alone tutorial so that others can learn from my experience.

## [String Calculator](https://github.com/kingsedem/portfolio-string-calculator#string-calculator-kata)

The string calculator is a simple Java coding exercise that introduced me to the concepts and practice 
of TDD and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function simple mathematical expressions
into numerical results. Some of the techniques I learned doing this exercise included String manipulation, Lambda expressions
and streams, and String formatting in Java.

## [The Java Fruit shop calculator](https://github.com/kingsedem/The-Java-fruit-shop#fruit-shop-cart-calculator-kata)

In this kata, I was introduced to the concepts and practice of  TDD, using JUnit 5 @BeforeEach annotations, Map 
and the red-green-refactor cycles. The goal of the kata is to create a function that checks the prices of items 
in a catalog and updates it with the current market price. It also performs other functions
such as (displaying products in alphabetical order, adds the total item and throws appropriate exceptions where applicable).
